# @cmmv/reactivity

This package was created from the [petite-vue](https://github.com/vuejs/petite-vue) project to provide basic context control functions similar to vue.js for the CMMV project frontend. Although it is possible to add a frontend framework to CMMV, we recommend that you use this version as the main one as its performance is much superior to using modular alternatives with complex component management.

- Only ~5kb
- Vue-compatible template syntax
- DOM-based, mutates in place

## Status

- This is pretty new. There are probably bugs and there might still be API changes, so **use at your own risk.** Is it usable though? Very much. Check out the [examples](https://github.com/andrehrferreira/cmmv-reactivity/tree/main/samples) to see what it's capable of.
